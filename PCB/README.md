# PCB
To build T-Top, two cutom PCBs must be made.

## Folder Structure
- The [psu_control](psu_control) folder contains the PCB files for PCB that controls and monitors the battery, audio amplifier, fans and LEDs.
- The [buck_boost](buck_boost) folder contains the PCB files for the Buck-Boost PCB.
- The [t-top.pretty](t-top.pretty) folder contains the custom footprints.
- The [t-top.lib](t-top.lib) file contains the custom parts.

## PSU Control PCB
- [Schematic](psu_control/schematic.pdf)
- [Gerber](psu_control/gerber)
- [Bill of Materials](../documentation/assembly/01_ORDER_PRINT_LASER_CUTTING.md#psu-control-pcb)

TODO Add a photo of the PCB with the connector description and pinout

## Buck-Boost PCB
- [Schematic](buck_boost/schematic.pdf)
- [Gerber](buck_boost/gerber)
- [Bill of Materials](../documentation/assembly/01_ORDER_PRINT_LASER_CUTTING.md#buck-boost-pcb)
